# From Git to Kubernetes

To summarize, we've seen how Kubernetes can be used to run workloads via [pods](2_pods.md).

To manage, scale and update multiple pods via [deployments](3_deployments.md). 

To interact with the endpoints exposed by multiple pods via [services](4_services.md).

Next, in order to show case an end to end process, we'll create, package, install and upgrade a trivial web application into a Kubernetes cluster.
